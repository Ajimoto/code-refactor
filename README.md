# code-refactor

code refactor challenge 02

# goal

-using tools I learned in the lessons to refactor this website and make it more accessible to others.
-gained a better understanding of how the HTML documents are structured and layed out to best suit developers and the viewers.

# useage

this website was refactored with ease of access in mind. I left comments in the sections with major changes, however, I did not comment of most of the css changes (as I deleted a number of class attributes)

# credits
